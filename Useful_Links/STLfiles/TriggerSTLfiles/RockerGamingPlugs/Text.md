These plugs are made by rocker, the difference with the normal ones is that this are **self compressing,** I just wanted to save these here just in case.


Now, you might be thinking, what's the difference between the normal version and v2? Of the plugs, well that's a nice one, in the .stl file I can only see a larger base difference between them, so when I found the purpose of this I'll edit it latter.

**Also Important to metion that this plugs if you printed yourself, you need a - resin printer -, since and fdm printer will have a difficult task printing those**
